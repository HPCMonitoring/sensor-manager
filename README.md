 â”£ ðŸ“‚configs                    # App envs and configuration
 â”£ ðŸ“‚constants                  # Constants and enums
 â”£ ðŸ“‚components                 # Reusable components across the web page

 â”£ ðŸ“‚types                      # Types for variables, objects ...
 â”£ ðŸ“œApp.tsx                    # App component

## Project configurations

### Code linting & formating

We use [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) to find and fix problem in code, such as:

- Unused variables
- Use `var` declaration
- Loosely comparation using `==`
- ...

You can run this command to test eslint script:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To maintain only one style coding across members, we use [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/). Try:

```bash
yarn format
```

You don't need to run these scripts regularly or before commiting code. They are run automatically before `git commit` command by setting as a precommit script. In some circumstances, precommit script is not enabled by default, just type two commands below to fix it:

```bash
chmod ug+x .husky/*
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

For a tip, two plugins above could be installed in `VSCode` as extensions.

### Barrelsby & Path alias

```py
............
 â”£ ðŸ“‚controllers
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œuser.ctrler.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚routes
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œuser.route.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚schemas
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚in
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œids.schema.ts
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œuser.schema.ts
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
............
```

Imagine you are in `user.ctrler.ts` and want to import `ASchema` from `ids.schema.ts`. The code can be like this:

```typescript
import { ASchema } from '../schemas/in/ids.schema.ts'
```

The more nested folders, the more bad looking importation. It is waste time to guess how many `..` should be put in relative path.

The solution is [`barrelsby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barrelsby) and **path alias**. With configurations in `.barrelsby.json`, barrelsby can import your entire code base in a specific folder, and re-export them in `index.ts` file.

Try this:

```bash
yarn barrels
```

To avoid using many `..` in relative path, config path alias in `tsconfig.json`. See the guideline [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping).

## Git working culture

- For every updates, DO NOT push directly to `master` branch. Create a new branch, commit, publish branch and create a pull request (PR) instead.
- A branch should have prefix `features/` for a feature update, prefix `hotfixes/` for a hotfix, `improvs/` for an improvement ...
- A PR should be small enough to review. To split a large PR, use [stacked PRs](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-stacked-pull-requests-in-github/).
